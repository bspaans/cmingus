                                    CMINGUS
================================================================================

  cmingus is a low priority implementation of the Python library mingus in C.
  mingus homepage: http://mingus.googlecode.com/

  * Why?

  For speed, cross compilation, compatibility and the usual shiggles.
  (And to go back to C - maybe I'll progress to C99!).

  My C style is apparently ancient, but I'll try to improve it as I go along. 
  Comments are welcome (via github or mail: bartspaans@gmail.com).
